<h2 id="the-fastest-sql-data-warehouse"><a class="header-link" href="#the-fastest-sql-data-warehouse"></a>The fastest SQL data warehouse</h2>
<p>Yellowbrick Data is a leader in next-generation data warehousing. Built 
for the hybrid cloud, the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse maximizes the value
 of data analytics by providing ultra-fast, predictable performance and 
flexible deployment options, including on-premises and in the cloud. As 
the world’s fastest SQL data warehouse, the Yellowbrick Data Warehouse 
easily scales from terabytes to petabytes, supports unmatched 
concurrency and delivers database query speeds up to 100X faster than 
traditional solutions.</p>
<p>Yellowbrick Data was founded in 2014 by 
experts in database and flash memory technologies to simplify data 
warehousing. The company wanted to solve the challenges of high 
availability, running complex mixed workloads, support for ad-hoc SQL, 
computing correct answers on any schema, massive scalability and 
supporting large numbers of concurrent users.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Yellowbrick built the 
Yellowbrick Data Warehouse which is quick to deploy, easy to expand and 
simple to manage. And in doing so, the firm also fundamentally changed 
the economics of enterprise data warehousing to deliver the lowest 
acquisition and operating costs, and highest performance to its 
customers.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Data Warehousing Without Limits</strong></p>
<p>Yellowbrick offers the elasticity and 
great user experience that Snowflake and other cloud-native data 
warehouses have, along with the reliability, control, deployment 
options, and excellent price/performance they don’t.</p>
<p>Yellowbrick Data Warehouse is a modern, 
MPP analytic database designed for the most demanding batch, real-time, 
interactive, and mixed workloads. We continuously implement the latest 
advances in software (e.g., Kubernetes) and hardware (e.g., NVMe) 
protocols, combine these advances with smart thinking about database 
architecture, and add on top a standards-based interface that’s familiar
 to users (PostgreSQL) for ecosystem compatibility.</p>
<p>The result is a modern, quickly 
provisioned, and easy-to-use solution that blows the doors off rivals in
 price/performance economics, and that can be deployed anywhere across 
distributed clouds (private, public, and edge networks).</p>
<p><strong>Modernize quickly and easily</strong></p>
<p>Get started with a test drive or POC and
 experience unmatched data warehouse performance. As a customer, our 
partners support you with a seamless production migration, providing the
 automation and expertise needed to get you on Yellowbrick.</p>
<p><strong>Safeguard your data under rigorous compliance standards</strong></p>
<p>Yellowbrick Data has experience serving 
customers in highly-regulated industries and government going back to 
its founding, so data and environment security are core values.</p>
<br br/>

<h2 id="paving-the-yellowbrick-road"><a class="header-link" href="#paving-the-yellowbrick-road"></a>Paving the Yellowbrick road</h2>
<p>Traditionally, data warehouses meant enterprises had to either commit
 to one platform or suffer the complexity of managing multiple 
quasi-compatible infrastructures. With that in mind, <a href="https://www.yellowbrick.com/">Yellowbrick Data</a> recently launched Yellowbrick Manager to make it easier for 
administrators to manage data warehouses across distributed cloud and 
on-premises deployments with a simplified interface.</p>
<p>Users can control Yellowbrick data warehouses in public clouds, on Yellowbrick hardware instances, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/13/robin-io-brings-pay-as-you-go-pricing-to-red-hat-private-clouds/">in private clouds,</a> and even at the network edge, the company said. Yellowbrick Manager 
provides a unified control system that uses the Kubernetes container 
orchestration system to enable users to manage and control both cloud 
and on-premises deployments with enhanced performance capabilities.</p>
<p>“It’s this single unified control plane, together with the adoption of 
Kubernetes in our database software, that sets us apart,” Yellowbrick 
CTO Mark Cusack told VentureBeat.</p>
<p>The company also added agile data movement capabilities to help 
customers integrate Yellowbrick with data lakes built on cloud object 
stores like Amazon S3. A technology preview is expected in early May, 
and general availability is set for the second half of 2021. Also in 
early May, there will be an update to Yellowbrick data warehouse release
 5, with data lake integration enhancements that include native support 
for cloud object storage (including Amazon S3 and Azure Data Lake 
Storage Gen 2).</p>
<br br/>

<h2 id="working-across-clouds"><a class="header-link" href="#working-across-clouds"></a>Working across clouds</h2>
<p>One of the criticisms of hybrid clouds has been around the disjointed
 set of technologies and user experiences across private and public 
clouds. There are different identity and access management approaches, 
which makes it harder to govern <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/18/the-great-data-decentralization-is-coming-are-you-ready/">access to data across these environments</a>,
 and they are typically provisioned differently. Yellowbrick is 
positioning itself as the first data warehouse for the distributed cloud
 by introducing a unified control plane that works across the most 
common cloud platforms. This control plane increases the simplicity of 
running multiple data warehouses in different physical and 
line-of-business locations across an enterprise.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes cloud native architecture provides Yellowbrick Manager with a
 single unified control panel to provision new data warehouse instances 
in different clouds, manage existing infrastructure, and monitor 
deployments.</p>
<p>Yellowbrick said Yellowbrick Data Warehouse queries run 3 times 
faster on Andromeda-optimized instances for private clouds than on the 
company’s first-generation architecture. The performance improvements 
are also the result of the company switching to new AMD 64-core CPUs, 
increasing bandwidth between server notes, and adding dual proprietary 
Kalidah scan accelerator cards that offload workloads such as filtering,
 compression/decompression, and row/column transposition from CPUs.</p>
<p>“The Andromeda instance is the fastest platform to run Yellowbrick on,” Cusack said.</p>
<p>The company is optimizing deployments to take advantage of 
differences across the big cloud providers. For example, if a public 
cloud instance has high-performance storage, Yellowbrick can adapt to 
the underlying hardware to take advantage of those benefits.</p>
<br br/>

<h2 id="the-yellowbrick-approach"><a class="header-link" href="#the-yellowbrick-approach"></a>The Yellowbrick approach</h2>
<p>Yellowbrick is focusing on improving the management aspects for distributed clouds rather than joining them together directly.</p>
<p>Competitors tend to fall into two major categories: legacy data 
warehouses such as Teradata, Oracle, and SQL Server or cloud-only data 
warehouses like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Microsoft Azure Synapse.
 Yellowbrick seeks to differentiate itself by taking a unified approach 
to addressing distributed data challenges like data gravity and 
sovereignty requirements. It was designed from the ground up to optimize
 price/performance across bare metal and virtualized infrastructure in 
public clouds.</p>
<p>Yellowbrick
 product marketing VP Justin Kestelyn says Yellowbrick has an advantage 
over legacy vendors that have been doubling down on older architectures 
and have a harder time with real-time analytics. Traditional cloud 
vendors have not been aggressively pursuing hybrid options for analytics
 at the edge.</p>
<p>“We’re winning business from all of these vendors by providing the best price/performance and the lowest deployment risk,” Cusack said.</p>
